# Hush

Hush is a program that helps a user store their account information in a secure way. After logging in, a user is able to add, view, edit and delete records that contain account information. Included in this program is a scripting system that allows a user to do something like changing their facebook password from the program itself. These scripts are in unencrypted JavaScript files and can be edited, added or deleted by any user.
